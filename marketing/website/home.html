            You know WordPress, Joomla or Drupal. They are all good in their primary objective: being a CMS 
            (of course with varying functionality). You know vBulletin, phpBB, Xenforo or the WoltLab Burning Board. 
            They are all good forum software. You know Wikipedia and therefore MediaWiki, the software behind Wikipedia, 
            which is an amazing wiki software.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what if you want to have a website that combines a CMS with a forum, a wiki and a store? A website where 
            you only have one login and a website that has the same style for every application. Surprisingly there is 
            no easy answer. It is possible but includes a lot of unnecessary overhead. The WoltLab Community Framework 
            is the first step in the right direction by centralizing key features like user and package management. But 
            it has many nasty elements if you want to develop for it. The best (actually worst) example of this is the 
            lack of automated tests. It is simply not possible to test the framework or any application with unit tests.

        <p>
            The 2martens Web Platform takes that idea, refines it, throws away the technical mistakes and brings it to 
            a whole new level by using Symfony as the technical foundation. Watch the 5 minutes long introduction video 
            on on this page to learn about the key features of the 2martens Web Platform.

            <span class="floatLeft icon icon-code icon96-custom"></span> <h3>OOP</h3>
            <p>
                The 2WP is completely written in OOP. If you ever had to debug code
                similar to the WordPress code, you will love the clean structure and strict separation of concerns.
                No large files where you don't know what they do. Every class has exactly one purpose. This allows for
                high maintainability and reduces debugging times severely.
                Furthermore 2WP is completely covered with unit and functional tests to minimize manual debugging to the 
                absolute minimum. Writing for 2WP becomes a joy, even if something doesn't work.

            <span class="floatLeft icon fa-cubes icon96-custom"></span> <h3>Expandability</h3>
            <p>
                The architecture is designed to embrace extensions. Wherever possible you can add event listeners to
                provide additional functionality without editing the original files, allowing for easy updates.

                package system to available events. In the documentation you can find everything you need to know for
