                You are a talented speaker? Then help us by talking to other people or presenting the
                2martens Web Platform at appropriate locations. You can find marketing presentations

            <p>
                You are good at making interesting videos? Help us by creating promotional videos
                about the 2martens Web Platform. If they don't suck, they can end up on our
                Youtube channel. These videos can be short 5 minute long teasers or longer
                feature presentations. The choice is yours. But if you really want to supplement
                our efforts, then take a look at the unassigned and open issues on our
                [url=https://github.com/2martens/meta/issues]meta[/url] repository for info
                about potentially needed videos.
